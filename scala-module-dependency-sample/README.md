# Depend on Scala modules like a pro

Two sample projects (Sbt and Maven) which demonstrate recommended configuration for projects that depend on newly spawned scala modules:

  * scala-xml for all classes that live in `scala.xml` package
  * scala-parser-combinators for all classes that live in `scala.util.parsing` package
  * scala-swing that has been brought into line with the rest of modules and changed its Maven group id

## Sbt sample

This sample demonstrates how to conditionally depend on all modules. If use only on some of the modules just edit the `libraryDependencies` definition accordingly. If you are just looking for a copy&paste snippet for your `build.sbt` file, here it is:

```scala
// add scala-xml dependency when needed (for Scala 2.11 and newer) in a robust way
// this mechanism supports cross-version publishing
// taken from: http://github.com/scala/scala-module-dependency-sample
libraryDependencies := {
  CrossVersion.partialVersion(scalaVersion.value) match {
    // if scala 2.11+ is used, add dependency on scala-xml module
    case Some((2, scalaMajor)) if scalaMajor >= 11 =>
      libraryDependencies.value ++ Seq(
        "org.scala-lang.modules" %% "scala-xml" % "1.0.3",
        "org.scala-lang.modules" %% "scala-parser-combinators" % "1.0.3",
        "org.scala-lang.modules" %% "scala-swing" % "1.0.1")
    case _ =>
      // or just libraryDependencies.value if you don't depend on scala-swing
      libraryDependencies.value :+ "org.scala-lang" % "scala-swing" % scalaVersion.value
  }
}
```

## Maven sample

This to depend on scala-xml module with assumption that you have `scalaBinaryVersion` property defined in your pom.xml file. The `scalaBinaryVersion` should be set to `2.11` for Scala 2.11.0. If you are just looking for copy&paste snippet for your `pom.xml` file, here it is:

```xml
<!-- taken from: http://github.com/scala/scala-module-dependency-sample -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.scala-lang.modules</groupId>
  <artifactId>scala-xml_${scalaBinaryVersion}</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.3</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.scala-lang.modules</groupId>
  <artifactId>scala-parser-combinators_${scalaBinaryVersion}</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.3</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.scala-lang.modules</groupId>
  <artifactId>scala-swing_${scalaBinaryVersion}</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

*NOTE*: Due to an [issue](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8358) in Scala compiler a project that uses scala-xml will compile successfully on Scala 2.11, even without an explicit dependency on the `scala-xml` module. However, it will fail at runtime due to missing dependency. In order to prevent that mistake we offer a workaround. Add `-nobootcp` Scala compiler option which will make scala-xml invisible to compilation classpath and your code will fail to compile when the dependency on `scala-xml` is missing. Check sample pom.xml for details.

### Scala cross-versioning with Maven

The snippet provided above allows you to declare dependencies on modules shipped against Scala 2.11. If you would like to
support building your project with both Scala 2.10 and 2.11 at the same time you'll need to use [Maven profiles](http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-profiles.html). Check the `pom.xml` file in the sample project for details how to set up Maven profiles for supporting different Scala versions.
